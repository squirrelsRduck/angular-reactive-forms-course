    For this simple dynamic forms array, we'll start out with the html template
    below. Note that the buttons in the template belwo are already wired up to
    methods in the component class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's first create a `FormArray` and bind it's value to the pre element at
    the bottom, and use the `*ngFor` structural directive and form bindings
    we've used in the past to bind our new `FormArray` to the template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, fill out the `addControl()` and `removeControl()` methods of the
    component class so that we can add and remove controls to the `FormArray`.
  </p>

<div *ngFor="let control of form.controls; let i = index;">
  <label [for]="'control-'+i">Item {{i}}: </label>
  <input type="text" [id]="'control-'+i" [formControl]="control"/>
  <button (click)="removeControl(i)">Remove</button>
</div>
<button (click)="addControl()">Add New Control To The Array</button>

<pre>Form Array value: {{ form.value | json}}</pre>
